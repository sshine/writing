# The Story of an Acorn

There once was a nut, light brown, rigid and not
in the knowhow of things on the ground, so it brings
me to gravity's toll on the innocent role
of a cumbersome seed, rather wingless indeed.

At first it felt free, separate from the tree:
in the air grew forth inexplicable glee
It could fly! so it thought, modesty turned to naught.
It could not, it would seem, with a bump and a gleam,
yes, the nut hit the ground to a stoppage.

So it came to be, among courteous weeds,
that a thistle would shade it from barbaric beaks.
Once the proud extension of twigs and leaves,
a delicious core in a hard shell of grief.

And as weather and wind and deer pellets akin
expunged all its ideas of glory within,
it was buried in crap, dead leaves, and with just that
came its prison of thought to a motionless drought.

Once in the ground came a slumber
It was so deep it soon would encumber
all dreams of this prince
but a word and a wince,
all remaining was
transformation.

Along came spring, to old thoughts none would cling
The young prince soon found out it had sprouted.
It was glorious, green, upright, and it would seem
to an ant it was just like a tree!

What was once an excrescence made its way to the present,
it had hatched, and the story in essence
is of life and of flight, and of colours so bright
emanating from shells once you let them.
