# The Story of an Acorn

There once was a nut, light brown, rigid and not<br>
in the knowhow of things on the ground, so it brings<br>
me to gravity's toll on the innocent role<br>
of a cumbersome seed, rather wingless indeed.

At first it felt free, separate from the tree:<br>
in the air grew forth inexplicable glee<br>
It could fly! so it thought, modesty turned to naught.<br>
It could not, it would seem, with a bump and a gleam,<br>
yes, the nut hit the ground to a stoppage.

So it came to be, among courteous weeds,<br>
that a thistle would shade it from barbaric beaks.<br>
Once the proud extension of twigs and leaves,<br>
a delicious core in a hard shell of grief.

And as weather and wind and deer pellets akin<br>
expunged all its ideas of glory within,<br>
it was buried in crap, dead leaves, and with just that<br>
came its prison of thought to a motionless drought.

Once in the ground came a slumber<br>
It was so deep it soon would encumber<br>
all dreams of this prince<br>
but a word and a wince,<br>
all remaining was<br>
transformation.

Along came spring, to old thoughts none would cling<br>
The young prince soon found out it had sprouted.<br>
It was glorious, green, upright, and it would seem<br>
to an ant it was just like a tree!

What was once an excrescence made its way to the present,<br>
it had hatched, and the story in essence<br>
is of life and of flight, and of colours so bright<br>
emanating from shells once you let them.
